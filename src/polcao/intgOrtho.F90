! Reminder about how the whole orthogonalization thing works. Consult the book
!   by Ching and Rulis and the reference: Ching WY, Lin CC. Orthogonalized
!   linear combinations of atomic orbitals: Application to the calculation of
!   energy bands of Si III. Physical Review B, 12(12), 5536, (1975).

! We will look at the case of the overlap matrix first. Note first a bit of
!   unusual notation. Let |v'> be a single element of the set of new valence
!   basis functions (from all atoms), let |c> be a single element of the set
!   of core basis functions (from all atoms), and let |v> be a single element
!   of the set of current valence basis functions (from all atoms). We will let
!   <c|v'> represent a single matrix element of the overlap between a
!   particular core basis function and a particular valence basis function.
!   Don't think of these as state vectors. Instead, they are just a particular
!   member of the valeDim or coreDim set of basis functions for the system.

! The basic goal is to take the existing valence basis functions (that created
!   the existing VV CV, VC, and CC matrices of overlap matrix elements) and
!   create a new set of basis functions that are orthogonal to the core basis
!   functions.

!   That is <c|v'> = <v'|c> = 0 for all elements.

!   Essentially, each matrix element of interaction between a basis function
!   from the core and a basis function from the new valence is equal to zero.

! Looking at equation 3.45 from the Ching-Rulis book on OLCAO (2012) we have:
!   |v'> = |v> + SUM( C|c> ).

!   Here, the sum is over all core basis functions and there is a different
!   coefficient for each core:valence basis function pair. Thus, in words,
!   our new valence basis function elements are the same as the old ones plus a
!   modification that is based on some weighted contribution from *each*
!   core basis function. The weighting will be *just right* so that the
!   new valence basis function elements will be orthogonal to the core basis
!   functions.

! Our goal now is to define the value of those coefficients. We do that by the
!   following:

!   Consider the overlap of the new valence basis function with *a particular*
!   core basis function. (Multiply from the left by <c|.)
!   <c|v'> = <c|v> + SUM( <c|C|c> )

!   Here, the SUM is still a single summation over the elements of the *right*
!   set of core basis functions |c>, but we are now summing the overlap of each
!   of the core basis functions with *a particular* other core basis function.
!   The trick is that the core basis functions that are on the same atomic
!   site are orthogonal to each other, and the overlap of core basis functions
!   is *assumed* to be zero between basis functions on *different* atomic sites.
!   Thus the term in the SUM will act like a delta function and pull out only
!   one C for *the particular* core basis function that we multiplied from the
!   left with, <c|. (If the assumption is wrong, then the process is much more
!   difficult and we will have to do something different.)

!   In words, the overlap of a given core basis function with one of the new
!   valence basis functions is equal to the overlap of the given core basis
!   function and the old valence basis function plus a single coefficient that
!   is specific for that core:valence pair.

! Rewriting the equation in the light of that discussion we have:
!   <c|v'> = <c|v> + C

! Now, we *demand* orthogonality between |c> and |v'> so that <c|v'> = 0.
!   0 = <c|v> + C

!   Or, the orthogonalization coefficients between core and valence basis
!   functions are just the negative of the matrix elements of the overlap
!   between the core and valence basis functions.

! Expressly: C = -<c|v> and C* = -<v|c> recalling that these are all just
!   single elements and not matrices per se.

! Now, let us construct the new VV overlap matrix. We start with the original
!   definition of |v'> = |v> + SUM( C|c> ). and multiply from the left by <v'|
!   on the left-hand side and by |v> + SUM( C|c> ) from the left on the right
!   hand side. With C* = complex conjugate of C. That is:
!   <v'|v'> = (<v| + SUM( C*<c| )) * (|v> + SUM( C|c> ))

! Thus, distributing:
!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> + SUM( <v|C|c> ) + SUM( C*<c|v> ) + SUM(SUM( C*<c|C|c> ))

!   Note again that each SUM is over the terms of the core basis function
!   inside the SUM parentheses. The double sum will have two separate sets of
!   indices. We also remind the reader that the equation is to be understood
!   as expressing a single matrix element. Thus, the C inside the SUM can be
!   moved to any position within the SUM(). With that knowledge we rewrite the
!   equation as:

!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> + SUM( <v|c>C ) + SUM( C*<c|v> ) + SUM(SUM( C*<c|c>C ))

! We expand C = -<c|v> and C* = -<v|c> to get:
!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> - SUM( <v|c><c|v> ) - SUM( <v|c><c|v> ) + 
!             SUM(SUM( <v|c><c|c><c|v> ))

!   Note that the first two SUMs are now identical.

!   A very tricky part is that the double SUM is over two different indices,
!   and the symbols are all basically the same. So, to help distinguish I have
!   added some indices:

! Reducing and adding indices, we have:
!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> - 2*SUM( <v|c><c|v> ) + SUM(SUM( <v|cj><cj|ci><ci|v> ))

! We can now translate this equation into a sequence of matrix operations to
!   produce the entire V'V' matrix from the set of matrix elements <v'|v'>.

! We take the original VV matrix and first subtract 2*[VC*CV]. Note that VC is
!   the complex conjugate transpose (or dagger) of CV. Then we add VC*CC*CV.
!   It doesn't matter what order we do the multiplication in (meaning either
!   (VC*CC)*CV or VC*(CC*CV)) because the number of floating point operations
!   is the same in both cases.

! Some comments:
! 1. The VC and CV matrices are complex conjugate transposes of each other.
!    (a.k.a the dagger operation). 
! 2. If we only store CV during the integrals process, then the first operation
!    (2*[VC*CV]) will "be fine" because the zherk call will include the
!    conjugate transpose effect in its operation. However, the last operation
!    (VC*CC*CV) is a set of separate calls so we would need to compute and
!    store the conjugate transpose of CV to be able to do it. *Alternatively*
!    we can store both the VC and CV. This will prove to be the wiser option
!    because we will need to make repeated use of both VC and CV for later
!    orthogonalization operations.
! 3. An interesting thought. Because we *do* compute VC ahead of time we could
!    just use it directly to perform 2*[VC*CV] as a simple matrix
!    multiplication. This might be faster because it may eliminate the need to
!    compute the conjugate transpose *again*, *within* the zherk call. Need to
!    explore this.

! Okay, now let's look at the case of orthogonalizing any VV matrix other than
!   the two-center overlap matrix.

! We have an similar situation, which is:
!   |v'> = |v> + SUM( C|c> ).

! The main difference is that now, we claim to already know the coefficients C.
!   The way that a given <v|v> kinetic energy matrix element needs to be
!   modified will be the same as the way that the overlap matrix needed to be
!   modified.

! Thus, we can immediately skip to:
!   <v'|v'> = (<v| + SUM( C*<c| )) * (|v> + SUM( C|c> ))

! Followed by:
!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> + SUM( <v|C|c> ) + SUM( C*<c|v> ) + SUM(SUM( C*<c|C|c> ))

!   Note again that each SUM is over the terms of the core basis function
!   inside the SUM parentheses. The double sum will have two separate sets of
!   indices. We also remind the reader that the equation is to be understood
!   as expressing a single matrix element (as opposed to a full matrix). Thus,
!   the C inside the SUM can be moved to any position within the SUM(). With
!   that knowledge we rewrite the equation as:

!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> + SUM( <v|c>C ) + SUM( C*<c|v> ) + SUM(SUM( C*<c|c>C ))

! Now, we can substitute in the expressions for C and C*, but we need to make
!   special note that those coefficients were obtained from the overlap
!   orthogonalization. That is:
!   C = -<c_OL|v_OL> and C* = -<v_OL|c_OL>

! Upon substitution:
!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> - SUM( <v|c><c_OL|v_OL> ) - SUM( <v_OL|c_OL><c|v> ) + 
!             SUM(SUM( <v_OL|c_OL><c|c><c_OL|v_OL> ))

!   A very tricky part is that the double SUM is over two different indices,
!   and the symbols are all basically the same. So, to help distinguish I have
!   added some indices:

! Adding indices, we have:
!   <v'|v'> = <v|v> - SUM( <v|c><c_OL|v_OL> ) - SUM( <v_OL|c_OL><c|v> ) + 
!             SUM(SUM( <v_OL|c_OLj><cj|ci><c_OLi|v_OL> ))

! We can now translate this equation into a sequence of matrix operations to
!   produce the entire V'V' matrix from the set of matrix elements <v'|v'>.

! We take the original VV matrix and first subtract [VC*CV_OL] followed by
!   subtracting [VC_OL*CV]. (That first step is what zher2k does.) Note that VC
!   is the complex conjugate transpose (or dagger) of CV. Then we add
!   VC_OL*CC*CV_OL.

! Some Comments:
! 1. Note that for the non-overlap matrices we do not need to store the
!    conjugate transpose of CV. We will make *use* of the VC_OL and CV_OL, but
!    we only need the CV, not the VC. The first operation -[VC*CV_OL]-[VC_OL*CV]
!    will "be fine" because it is all taken care of by the zher2k call. The
!    conjugate transpose of CV is included. However, the second operation does
!    not make use of VC, only VC_OL, CC, and CV_OL.
